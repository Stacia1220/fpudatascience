Put your name and a brief reflection on what you think of Github! 
Brandon: Github can be confusing but I love how it keeps track of changes! 
This is during the live class! 
Chris Brownell, I see this as a giant mysterious place where the druid gods of the internet reside.

Kaylin Everett. This seems like a good tool to collaborate when writing programs.
After reading the blog by Dan Meyer about secondary teachers creating and utilizing a "lesson plan Github" for math, I can relate to the frustrations that would arise.  Even if one decides to use a lesson from such a repository, it still needs to be tailored to the class, i.e., EL learners, IEP plans, scheduling, different pacing calendars, etc.  The idea of getting "ideas" seems widely accepted, but not the lesson plans.  Google docs already serves as means to collaborate on lessons, though it could use some work.  The video that explains how Github is useful, with the farmers and their tractors, shows the power of this platform for programers, but implementing this into our profession seems difficult.
Stacia: It was nice working in a program already there and editing with python. Github looks like a good tool for calloboration especially with a computer programing class.
This does not quite seem like a tool that is good for writing but seems great for programming. It is nice that you can see edits and have to approve them.
