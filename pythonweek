Put your name and a brief reflection on what you think of Github! 
Brandon: Github can be confusing but I love how it keeps track of changes! 
This is during the live class! 
Chris Brownell, I see this as a giant mysterious place where the druid gods of the internet reside.

Kaylin Everett. This seems like a good tool to collaborate when writing programs.
After reading the blog by Dan Meyer about secondary teachers creating and utilizing a "lesson plan Github" for math, I can relate to the frustrations that would arise.  Even if one decides to use a lesson from such a repository, it still needs to be tailored to the class, i.e., EL learners, IEP plans, scheduling, different pacing calendars, etc.  The idea of getting "ideas" seems widely accepted, but not the lesson plans.  Google docs already serves as means to collaborate on lessons, though it could use some work.  The video that explains how Github is useful, with the farmers and their tractors, shows the power of this platform for programers, but implementing this into our profession seems difficult.
Stacia: Working the pythont this week with a preprogrammed line of code seemed to work a lot better for me. Github seems like a great collaboration tool when writing code. It does not seem like the best tool to use for text but when it comes to coding I could see the benefits in using this. Being able to see edits and wait for them to be approved could be very beneficial. I am not sure how I would use this in my current classroom but if I was teaching a coding class this seems like gold.
